# Arena_Ds

### MVC Battlegame for python
## PGA

### Concept
This project began as a merging of two simple ideas: 
1. How can I make a version of our NuCamp intro to Python game, that doesn't suck
2. How can I incorporate MVC design patterns into the game

This version is a variation to practice Dataset and SQLAlchemy

### Technology Used
* Python
* Basic MVC design pattern developed from G. Debidda's MVC patterns article series (originally a simple 3 field--table--usage, but fairly useful as a character creation approach if re-designed...so a nod to GD for the great insight on how to use this useful design pattern in a simple, practical way to understand at the intermediate level): https://www.giacomodebidda.com/posts/mvc-pattern-in-python-dataset/  4-15-2017 (date of article)
* SQLite3 
* SQLAlchemy
* Dataset

#### Files included/ Separation of Concerns:
1. Original Battlegame.py from NuCamp's week1 python classes (for README reference ease)
2. This README
3. The Arena game's driver code
4. dunder init file (my favorite)
5. basic helper methods file: arena_method.py
6. Backend CRUD
7. Exceptions file
8. Controller
9. Model
10. View
